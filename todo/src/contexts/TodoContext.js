/*
Simpler Syntax: useContext directly returns the context value, while Consumer requires a function as a child, making the code more verbose.

No Nesting: useContext avoids the need for nested Consumer components, which makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.

Modern Approach: useContext is part of the React Hooks system, which is the modern and recommended way to work with context in functional components.

Cleaner Code: useContext makes code more readable and easier to debug, as it doesnâ€™t require passing a function to access context.

Preferred for Functional Components: useContext works seamlessly with functional components, whereas Consumer is more suited for class components.

In short, useContext is simpler, cleaner, and the modern approach for accessing context in functional components.
